They'll produce an answer, and try to do it quickly - but don't expect any long lived code in here.


## Clever bits
 - Program.cs uses reflection and naming convention to find the right day to run.
 - Day 5 replaces LR with binary for parsing
 - Day 20 with modulo math on compass directions (NESW + 2)
   - also using bitmasks for side matching
   - regex monster /\/\/\*<
   - also also just a mind melting amount of flipping and rotating.
 - Day 23 has a circular linked list and value index for faster crabs.
